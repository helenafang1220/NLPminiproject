Adverse incentives that favor higher-cost biologics are keeping lower-cost biosimilars from reaching patients. We can‚Äôt think of a more concerning example of a broken system.,
An important first step is capping the out-of-pocket costs seniors experience in the Medicare drug program.,
"Imagine a system where Pfizer gets paid based on the number of heart attacks prevented, rather than the number of pills we sold.",
"Pfizer supports a system in which transparent, upfront discounts directly benefit patients. In the current system, none of the approximately 12 billion dollars in rebates that Pfizer paid in 2018 found its way to American patients.",
