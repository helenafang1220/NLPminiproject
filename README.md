<h2>DSAI Course Term 1 - NLP Mini Project 2021</h2>
<h4>☞Demonstrating Topic Analysis Through LSA and LDiA</h4>

This is a mini project as part the NLP course module. During the time period, <b><i>AstraZeneca(AZ)</b></i> jab was criticised due to rare blood clot cases. The criticism has caused people in Taiwan unwilling to take vaccination, when there was only limited access to vaccines. Meanwhile, there were also a huge preference to <b><i>Pfizer vaccine</b></i>, believing it performs better than other vaccine manufacturers. 

I therefore made an analysis for the comments on Twitter, to inspect the crowds attitudes on social media hashtags about Pfizer and AZ vaccine. 

The method applies <b>data wrangling</b>:
<ol>
<li>text cleaning</li>
<li>word tokenisation</li>
</ol>

Then applies <b>topic analysis</b>, including:
<ol>
<li>tf-IDF calculate token frequency</ul></li>
<li>LSA for generating topics</li>
<li>LDiA as alternative analysis with visualisation</li>
</ol>

<h4>LSA 10 topics on #AstraZeneca Tweets</h4><br>
From the topic generated, I can quickly organise several events appeared in the 20000 tweets. 
<ul>
<li>“moms” finally got their vaccination</li>
<li>EMA (European Medicines Agency) authorisation towards the AZ vaccine</li>
<li>Sri Lanka shortages on vaccine and received large AZ from Japan</li>
<li>AZ vaccine rare blood clot cases</li>
<li>Blood clot cases related to women contraceptive pills</li>
<li>People finally getting 2nd vaccination</li>
</ul>

Overall, there are more positive hashtags and mentions about Pfizer vaccine. There seems to be a campaign for Pfizer vaccine that worth further investigate. 
Whereas AZ is more about its legal aspect and discussion on blood clot cases.
