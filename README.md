NLP Mini Project 2021 

Demonstrating Topic Analysis Through LSA and LDiA

This is a mini project as part the NLP course module. During the time period, AstraZeneca (AZ) jab was criticised due to rare blood clot cases. The criticism has caused people in Taiwan unwilling to take vaccination, when there was only limited access to vaccines. Meanwhile, there were also a huge preference to Pfizer vaccine, believing it performs better than other vaccine manufacturers. 

I therefore made an analysis for the comments on Twitter, to inspect the crowds attitudes on social media about Pfizer and AZ vaccine. 

The method applied data wrangling:
<li>
<ul>text cleaning</ul>
<ul>word tokenisation</ul>
</li>

Then applied topic analysis technique, including:
<li>
<ul>tf-IDF calculate token frequency</ul>
<ul>LSA for generating topics</ul>
<ul>LDiA as alternative analysis with visualisation</ul>
</li>
